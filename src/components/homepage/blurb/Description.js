const Description = "Welcome! I'm Alon Nusem, a Mechatronics and Computer Science student at The University of Queensland, passionate about all things technology related. This website is a space for me to share the projects I am working on and document my design process, while learning more myself and hopefully teaching more people about technology. My projects focus on both software and hardware, with a passion in modular design. From the formation of an idea to the developement of a prototype you can follow me as I progress through my projects, documenting my design decisions as best I can."
